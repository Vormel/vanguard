        <h2>Learning the tools</h2>
        <p>
            First week, we will be dedicated to getting everyone familiar with the required tools, <br>
            all of which can be found on the <a href="./resources.html">resources page</a>. <br>
            Completing the tutorials listed on the resources page is strongly recommended.

        <h2>Structure & content</h2>
        <p>
            Second week, the structure of the website will be finalized. <br>
            This includes the number of subpages, purposes, and contents of said subpages. <br>
            We'll also focus on maintaining a smooth navigation experience throughout the website. <br>
            <br>
            The navigation and structure will be visually outlined in mockup flow charts <br>
            and wireframes respectfully. <br>

            <br>
            Work on the written content of the website will also start at this level. <br>

        <h2>HTML Skeleton</h2>
        <p>
            Third week, we will be dedicated to transforming the website mockups into <br>
            HTML documents. Placeholder text and images will be used while actual <br>
            content is being worked on. <br>
            <br>
            The navigation menu will be implemented according to the flowcharts <br>
            and adjusted to fit the layout. HTML structure will be implemented <br>
            to roughly match the wireframe mockups in preparation for the design stage. <br>
            <br>
            <b>During this stage, ensuring consistency in the use of HTML elements will be the most important part.</b>
            E.g. make sure to be consistent with how you utilize different HTML elements, <br>
            do not randomly switch between h2 and h3 or swap div for section. <br>
            <br>
            Work on text contents of the website will continue and will slowly start <br>
            to replace placeholder text.

        <h2>CSS Design</h2>
        <p>
            Fourth week, we will be focused on the design aspect of the website - in other words, CSS. <br>
            During this stage, we will work with the media team to come up with a website theme. <br>
            <br>
            Placeholder pictures will be replaced with finished media pieces, <br>
            color scheme will be decided to match the clan theme and animations will be added. <br>
            <br>
            <b>At this stage the website can be considered finished.</b>

        <h2>Additional features</h2>
        <p>
            Once the website is finished, a developer team will be assigned to maintain <br>
            and innovate the website. Features to be added post-completion include:
            <ul>
                <li>React.js rewrite</li>
                <li>Discord sign-in</li>
                <li>Backend server</li>
                <li>Public API</li>
                <li>Integration with SEAN</li>
            </ul>
