        <h2>Learning the tools</h2>
        <p>
            First week will be dedicated to getting everyone familiar with the required tools, <br>
            all of which can be found on the <a href="./resources.html">resources page</a>. <br>
            <b>Completing the tutorials listed on the resources page is strongly recommended.</b>

        <h2>Structure & content</h2>
        <p>
            During second week the structure of the website will be finalized. <br>
            This includes the number of subpages, purpose and content of said subpages <br>
            and navigation flow throuhg the website. <br>
            <br>
            The structure and navigation will be outlined in mockup flow charts <br>
            and wireframes. <br>

            <br>
            Work on the writen content of the website will also begin at this stage. <br>

        <h2>HTML Skeleton</h2>
        <p>
            Week three will be dedicated to transforming the website mockups into <br>
            HTML documents. Placeholder text and images will be used while actual <br>
            content is being worked on. <br>
            <br>
            The navigation menu will be implemented according to the flowcharts <br>
            and adjusted to fit the layout. HTML structure will be implemented <br>
            to roughly match the wireframe mockups in preparation for the design stage. <br>
            <br>
            <b>During this stage, ensuring consistnecy in the use of HTML elements will be the most important part.</b> <br>
            E.g. make sure to be consistent with how you utilize different HTML elements, <br>
            do not rendomly switch between h2 and h3 or swap div for section. <br> 
            <br>
            Work on text contents of the website will continue and will slowly start <br>
            to replace placeholder text.

        <h2>CSS Design</h2>
        <p>
            Last week will be focused on the design aspect of the website, in other words - CSS. <br>
            During this stage we will work with the media team to come up with a website theme. <br>
            <br>
            Placeholder pictures will be replaced with finished media pieces, <br>
            color sheme will be decided to match the clan theme and animations will be added. <br>
            <br>
            <b>At this stage the website can be considered finished.</b>
